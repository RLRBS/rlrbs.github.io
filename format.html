        <h3>Open Qualifier</h3>
        <p>
          All eligible teams will be entered into the "open qualifier" stage of
          RLRBS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeding will be determined by admins/staff using statistics gathered
          from RL6Mans NA.
        </p>

        <p>
          The open qualifier will be a double elimination format.
        </p>

        <p>
          All initial matches in the open qualifier will be best of three; once
          play has proceeded to Round of 16, matches in winner’s bracket will be
          best of five (loser’s bracket will remain best of three for the
          entirety of the Qualifier).
        </p>
        <p>
          The final 12 teams remaining at the conclusion of the qualifier will
          qualify to participate in RLRBS league play.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3>League Play</h3>

        <p>
          League play is a round robin with the twelve teams that qualified
          through the open qualifier; these teams will play one (1) best of five
          against every other team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rankings will be determined by comparing the total number of match
          wins received by a team during league play. If there is a tie, ranking
          will be determined by game differential.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a team disqualifies from a match for any reason, the match will be
          recorded as a 3-0 win in favor of the opposing team.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3>Playoffs</h3>

        <p>
          The top six (6) ranked teams after the conclusion of league play will
          compete in the RLRBS playoffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams will be seeded from first through sixth based on their
          performance in league play.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Playoffs will be a single elimination format for the first round,
          but will become a double elimination bracket from the second round
          onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top two (2) ranked teams after the conclusion of league play will
          receive a first round bye.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the conclusion of the playoffs, the winning team will receive the
          entire prize pool.

        <h3>Tiebreakers</h3>

        <p>
          If two or more teams within league play achieve the same number of
          match wins, resulting in a tie, the tie(s) will be resolved by
          applying the following tiebreaking mechanisms:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Overall game differential
          </li>

          <li>
            Head to head
          </li>
